# DurianChain – Blockchain-Powered Durian Traceability System

## Introduction
DurianChain is a hybrid Web2/Web3 decentralized application (DApp) designed to combat fraudulent practices in Malaysia’s durian industry, particularly the mislabeling of cheaper varieties such as D24 as the premium Musang King. By leveraging blockchain technology, DurianChain ensures end-to-end transparency, authenticity, and accountability in the supply chain — from farm to consumer.

This system integrates role-based access control, QR code product verification, and immutable blockchain records to provide a tamper-proof history of each durian batch. Consumers, exporters, regulators, and retailers can all verify the origin, quality, and handling of durians through a simple QR code scan, strengthening trust in Malaysia’s premium durian exports.
