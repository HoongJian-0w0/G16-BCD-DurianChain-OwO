# DurianChain â€“ Blockchain-based Durian Traceability System

DurianChain is a de
centralized application designed to track the journey of durians from farms to consumers using blockchain technology.  
The system ensures authenticity, transparency, and traceability by storing critical supply chain events on-chain, with supporting documents stored via IPFS.

## ðŸš€ Testnet Deployment
As part of the development process, **DurianChain has been deployed to the Sepolia Testnet** to validate smart contract interactions and blockchain integration before mainnet launch.  
This additional step ensures that all role-based functions and transaction flows work as intended in a real blockchain environment.

You can view and monitor the deployment through the Alchemy dashboard:
